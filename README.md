This project was our first introduction into carrierwave and using that to upload photos.  Some key takeaways for me:
  - practice with Uploader to allow users to add their photos and access them
  - modifying our config environment to store photos

I didn't expand too far with this project, but it was a great learning experience because it gave us the ability to use photo upload on later projects.
